# BBDN-LTI-Tool-Provider-Node
This project is a multi-purpose application designed to demonstrate several integration methods available with Blackboard Learn. The application is an LTI 1.1, LTI 1.3, and Advantage Tool Provider. It also has code to emit Caliper events, as well as act as a very basic caliper eventstore. 

Upon launch of the LTI Tool, the user is given a few options:

- Send Outcomes: Send a Grade to the Tool Consumer with LTI Outcomes
- Caliper: Register your Tool as a Caliper Provider and then emit an event to the caliper service. In addition, an endpoint is provided to consume caliper events from the Blackboard Learn server.
- Blackboard REST: The application provides a method to retrieve a REST token and then retrieve the user and course objects based on the UUID passed in the LTI launch.
- Deep Linking: The application provides a method to send Content Item Messages back to Learn simulating a Content provider. This provides a menu of predefined message loads as well as the option to add a custom load.
- Names & Roles Service: Request members for course that launched the tool.
- Assignment & Grades Service: With LTI Advantage a new service is available to get, create, and update line items in the gradebook.
- Return to Learn: This will take the return URL in the LTI Launch and return the user to that place in Blackboard Learn. If no URL is provided, the user is returned to the top-level domain they came from.

## Requirements
- [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org) - Installing node on Windows requires installing a number of additional packages. It will warn you and if you don't want the script to do it automatically, the installer will give you a link to instructions to run the installs manually.
- [Redis](http:redis.io) - On Mac it's easiest to `brew install redis`. The code assumes the default
host and port (localhost:6379). On Windows, its easiest to use docker. Running `docker pull redis` will download the latest redis release in a docker image that you can run as required. If you need to run redis on a different host or port, update your config_override.json

## Configuration
You can override a number of configuration properties by creating a config_override.json file in server/config. Below is an example:

```js
{
  "frontend_url": "https://example.com/"
  "provider_port": "9008",
  "redis_host": "localhost",
  "redis_port": 6379
}
```

If you want to run under SSL you should use a reverse proxy, like nginx or ngrok.

## How To Run the code
All packages needed are in the package.json.

You should have node installed (built with v16.3.0). Then from the project directory at the command line, type `npm start`. This will install all of your dependencies and start the server.

Access the application via http://localhost:3000. You can customize the host name and port number by creating a server/config/config_override.json file (see the server/config/config.json file for a template)

### Base LTI 1.1.x functionality and Membership service
To launch the LTI 1 tool, you must launch into the application as an LTI Tool with the url, http://localhost:3000/lti.

### Deep Linking 1.0
To launch the Content Provider simulation call the tool with this url, http://localhost:3000/CIMRequest for use with LTI 1.1.
Add the parameter "custom_option" with a value of 1 - 5 (e.g. CIMRequest?custom_option=1) and the corresponding predefined message load from the menu

## Usage
The application is very simple in its current iteration. Essentially there is one page with a bunch of buttons. Click the one you want. If you are testing caliper, ensure you click the register caliper button at least once. This registers your tool with Blackboard and provides the application with the API Key and Caliper end point.
Also, if you wish to ingest Blackbaord's caliper events, you will need to register your application as a caliper event store, which is done in Blackboard Learn.

See the <a href="https://docs.blackboard.com/standards/caliper/getting-started/caliper-event-store-for-learn" target="_blank">developer documentation site</a> for more details.

## Developing
This is not meant to be a Node.JS tutorial. It is simply an example of how one might implement the various features therein. Pull requests are welcome!

# LTI Advantage Tool

Implementation of IMS Global LTI v1.3 and LTI Advantage.

## Setup

A screencast of the rough LTI Advantage setup is shown in [Eric Preston's demo at 23:00](https://us.bbcollab.com/recording/e193c6cb59cb4ed1a776c271665d4154).

1. Install and start redis

   On Mac it's easiest to `brew install redis`. The code assumes the default host and port (localhost:6379).
   
   On Windows, it's easiest to use the redis docker image. With Docker Desktop installed, at a command prompt, run `docker pull redis` and then `docker run -p 6379:6379 --name lti-redis -d redis`.

2. Start the server with `npm start`.

   Check that you can access https://example.com/setup

   You should see the following output:

   ```sh
   Home page:  https://example.com
   LTI 1 Tool Provider:  https://example.com/lti
   LTI 1 Content Item: https://example.com/CIMRequest
   LTI 1.3 Login URL: https://example.com/login
   LTI 1.3 Redirect URL: https://example.com/lti13,https://example.com/deepLinkOptions
   LTI 1.3 Launch URL: https://example.com/lti13
   LTI 1.3 Deep Linking URL: https://example.com/deepLinkOptions
   JWKS URL: https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
   Setup URL: https://example.com/setup
   ```

3. Register your application on the Blackboard Developer Portal

   - *Issuer*: The *Issuer* from the developer portal
   - *Application Key*: The application key provided by the dev portal
   - *Application Secret*: The application secreted provided by the dev portal 

   Click *SAVE*

5. Add the tool to your Learn instance

  - Sign into your Learn instance as an administrator
  - Navigate to *Administrator Tools* > *Integrations* > *LTI Tool Providers* > *Register LTI 1.3 Tool*
  - In the *Client ID* field enter the *Application ID* copied from the developer portal
  - Click *Submit*
  - Navigate to *Administrator Tools* > *Integrations* > *REST API Integrastions* > *Create Integration*
  - Enter the Application ID, a Learn user, leave End User Access to *Yes*

6. Create a placement for the tool

   In the *LTI Tool Providers* list, select *LTI 1.3 Example App* > *Manage Placements* > *Create Placement*
   Enter the following fields:
     -  *Label*: LTI 1.3 Example App
     -  *Handle*: LTI 1.3 Example App
     - *Type*: Course tool
     - *Tool Provider URL*: https://example.com/lti13

   Click *Submit*

7. Launch the tool

   ### Original
   Navigate to a course. Click on *Tools*. You should see your LTI 1.3 Example App

   ### Ultra
   Navigate to a course. Under Details & Actions click *Books & Tools*. You should see your tool

## Basic LTI 1.3 tool launch
The normal LTI Resource link should launch to http://localhost:3000/lti13.

## Assignment and Grade Services 2.0
If enabled on the LMS this will be available in the tool.

## Names and Roles Provisioning Services 2.0
If enabled on the LMS this will be available in the tool.

## Deep Linking 2.0
The Deep Linking Request should launch to http://localhost/deepLinkOptions to be able to select content items and counts to return. Possible content items are:
- LTI Link
- Content Link

# Docker

Docker specific files are included (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, launch.sh).

Use config_override.json (same entries as config.json) to override `redis_host` from localhost to redis so it can access the redis docker container. 
If running the docker image on the same machine as the learn instance then the `docker-compose.yml` needs to contain the ip address of the machine being used. 

Build the LTI tool container with `docker build -t lti-tool .`. Then start containers using `docker-compose up`.
